    "\n",
    "The Community Earth System Model ({cite}CESM) is science expressed in Software, which means everyone who touches CESM code to work on the science -- is doing RSE work. There is a list of challenges that CESM RSE’s have with both bringing in new science for CESM and ensuring CESM is well tested, robust, flexible as well as having the correct science. As such CESM Scientists working in CESM code need to work alongside CESM RSE’s to adopt RSE practices while their science is being developed. For CESM to be useful for scientists it needs to be: well-tested, robust, reproducible, flexible and have assurance that the science is implemented correctly. This is needed both for the science and the software of CESM. Helping  scientists embrace their inner RSE is an effort to keep CESM as a leading model in Earth System Science research, by having more people who work with the CESM code adopt good coding practices. In this talk I will specifically talk about RSE practices for the Land Model component of CESM, the Community Terrestrial Science Mode ({cite}CTSM)l. I will present on the RSE challenges we have in CTSM and how to solve them we need to involve and educate CTSM scientists to improve our RSE practices. I will also present regarding the CTSM RSE team’s efforts to educate the scientists and on some improvements to our RSE practices that we’ve been implementing on our CTSM Software Development.\n",

    "\n",
     "CESM has been a multi-decadal project for studying the Earth's Climate System. It's a large software system of millions of lines of code with interdisciplanary experts spanning many scientific disciplines from Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Cyrosphere, including RSE's tasks with keeping the software itself working in a sustainable way.",
