    "We've presented the problem of having untrained scientists contributing code to a community model without high levels of computer science training or RSE best practices -- what do we do about it? The most important question is what might be most effective in ameliorating the situation? The first thing to recognize is what are the practices that have been shown to have the best impact on having sustainable code? So we want to adopt practices that have been shown to be effective in the SE Industry and by other RSEs. The three big categories that the SE Industry and Research has found to help are: requirements, design and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Practices does the SE/RSE Industry Recommend?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Figure out what the software needs to do REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "(neither too much or too little).\n",
    "- Spend effort into DESIGN of the code itself.\n",
    "- Add automated TESTING WHILE you develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the big picture, the most important practices have to do with: requirements, design and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RSE Maxim to Live By\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple phrase illustrates the importance of software testing and maintaining testing going forward. It's something that I latched onto and continue to use since the first time I heard it over 20 years ago.\n",
    "- Untested Code – IS broken (or will get broken).\n",
    "- So…\n",
    "Don’t add untested code.\n",
    "- Do testing and add testing to test suites.\n",
    "- Continue to run test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of RSE Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of practices that I think are worth teaching to scientists. To make this easier it's useful to move away from technical language used in Computer Science and to use metaphors that are more memorable than technical terms.\n",
    "- Small Circle JuJitsu (small cycles).\n",
    "- Trim the Fat (requirements).\n",
    "- Draw the Building (design code changes before starting).\n",
    "- Preserve Success (git version control).\n",
    "- Practice Vulnerability (openly share code/issues).\n",
    "- Trust but Verify – Test AS You Go (Test-Driven Development TDD).\n",
    "- Improve Design as you go (refactoring).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small Circle JuJitsu (small cycles)\n",
    "\n",
    "Software Development Methodologies are based around the following steps:\n",
    "1. Requirements (what does it need to do).\n",
    "1. Design (figure out what the code should look like).\n",
    "1. Implement (actually do coding).\n",
    "1. Test (verify that the code is correct).\n",
    "1. Deploy (Finish it and give to others).\n",
    "1. Refactor (Improve design – just for Agile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Waterfall Software Development is one extreme, with a single monolithic pass. Agile Software Development is at the other extreme, continually doing small cycles of the above steps.\n",
    "The illustration in {numref}`Fig-cycle` is a reminder to do things in smaller manageable cycles, rather than large cycles that are too big.\n",

    "By working in smaller cycles a usable bit of work can be brought in more quickly and when sufficient unit-testing is added from the beginning it can be refined as needed.\n",

    "**How we do this in CTSM**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CTSM development there's a couple different ways we try to do this. One is just to figure out small baby steps to take to accomplish a given larger task. Some of the steps should be simple without changing answers, and the steps that do change answers should be isolated and as small as possible. To help facilitate this type of process we have a \"b4b-dev\" branch where simple changes can come in that don't change answers. The changes put on that branch then come to the main development every two weeks. Another way we do this is to use github project boards for more involved projects, as well as checklists in issues and PR's.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example project board is the ctsm5.2 project board with detailed cards that manage small tasks. [ctsm5.2 github project board](https://github.com/orgs/ESCOMP/projects/36)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trim the Fat (requirements)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you rush into writing code, you'll likely try to do too much, or do things that aren't really necessary. Or for that matter you might forget something that's critical to do. So spend time working on \"trimming the fat\" both when you start a cycle, as well as while you in a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before starting a development cycle -- figure out exactly what you need to do for this cycle.\n",
    "- Make sure you don’t do too much.\n",
    "- Or too little.\n",
    "- Sticking to it later – helps avoid scope creep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photo in {numref}`Fig-trim` illustrates doing this using the cooking analogy where you trim the fat off before cooking. In the same way you try to plan to only do a small amount for an upcoming cycle that you define clearly. Then when you are in the project you make sure you are only doing the things that you said you would and not adding additional things to do. Those additional things may still be important to do, but they can be done in a future cycle. One way to do this is to keep track of them by making them an issue in github. And then you can have a process for prioritizing the issues and make sure you are always working on the most important ones.\n",

    "**How we do this in CTSM**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CTSM development one way we do this is by adding \"Definition of Done:\" to issues and Pull Requests (PRs) in order to have a clear definition of what we plan to do and how we define being done with it. A CTSM issue that demonstrates this is https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/2720. This can also be done in github project boards, and planning documents. The most important thing is to think about it before a coding project is started as well as updating it as needed along the way.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "### Draw the Building (design code changes before starting)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next recommendation is to think about the design of the code and make sure what you are doing is done in a clean way, that is natural for the codebase. If there are good design patterns in the code similar to what you need to do, you can copy those patterns and do something similar. However, in some cases there are multiple patterns or poorly designed ones that you should NOT copy. This is the case in CTSM where we have some bad code patterns that shouldn't be copied and some that are better and should be copied. And sometimes a reasonable pattern is maybe just poorly implemented and could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about the CTSM code and how your changes come in.\n",
    "- Go for clean interfaces that ideally isolate the changes and logic in a modular fashion.\n",
    "- Use helper functions to reduce code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure {numref}`Fig-design` illustrates this in the way that an architect creates drawings of a building before starting construction, similarly the design of the software should be thought about before you start coding. You also want to make sure you spend time in thinking of more than one way to do it, so the best option can be chosen. And others can be consulted on the design choices to see if they see changes to make before you start coding. Once coding has started, changing the design becomes counterproductive.\n",

    "::: {tip}\n",
    "**How we do this in CTSM**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CTSM development one way we do this is by creating a design document to cover how we think the code should look. We do not do extensive design documents that cover the entirety of CTSMm but short documents a few pages that explain the current design and the design to move to. The main purpose of the design document is for the design to be thought about and worked through. So it can be done with diagrams and even done on a whiteboard with others to figure out the high level structure. We have a structure to do this in markdown or restructured text in the repository as well as Google docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a template we have for these types of documents in markdown [CTSM design document template](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/blob/master/doc/design/design_doc_template.md).

    "### Preserve Success (git version control)\n",
    "\n",
    "In software projects everyone has the problem of you get it working -- and then you make a change and you break it. But, you don't quite remember what you changed, so you have trouble getting it back to the working state. Using version control you save off the working versions, so you can always get back to a working version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow advice on CTSM github wiki pages {cite}`githubCTSM`.\n",

    "### Practice Vulnerability (openly share code/issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to write good scientific code is to work in a team that can provide feedback on your code as for you do the same for others. Very often scientists are embarrassed about sharing their code with RSEs. This is a tendency that needs to be overcome, with gentle encouragement. It also means developing good team dynamics where people can be vulnerable with the code they share with others. This is especially effective when the code sharing goes both ways, and since I know you are going to review my code, I know to be gentle with my review of your code -- because you are going to do the same for me. It also helps to realize code is a shared resource, we all want to improve it for the benefit of everyone. It helps to let go of the idea of the code I write is `mine`. It also helps to realize that everyone writes terrible code. This is for a variety of reasons, but especially because of lack of time for example. Getting over that embarrassment helps us to share and improve our code as a team.\n",
