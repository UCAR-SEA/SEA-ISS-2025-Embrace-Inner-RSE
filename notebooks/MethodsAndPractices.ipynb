    "Now that we've presented the problem, of having untrained scientists contributing code to a community model without high levels of computer science training or RSE best practices. The question is what might be most effective in ameliorating the situation? The first thing to recognize is what are the practices that have been shown to have the best impact on having sustainable code? So we want to adopt practices that have been shown to be effective in the SE Industry as well by other RSEs. The three big categories that the SE Industry and Research has found to help are: requirements, design and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Practices does the SE Industry Show Helps?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Figure out what the software needs to do REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "(neither too much or too little)\n",
    "- Spend effort into DESIGN of the code itself\n",
    "- Add automated TESTING WHILE you develop\n",

    "So in the big picture the most important practices have to do with: Requirements, Design and Test\n",

    "## RSE Maxim to Live By\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple phrase that's easy to use as a way to illustrate the importance of software testing and maintaining testing going forward. It's something that I latched onto and continue to use since the first time I heard it over 20 years ago.\n",
    "- Untested Code – IS broken (or will get broken)\n",
    "- So…\n",
    "Don’t add untested code\n",
    "- Do testing and add testing to test suites\n",
    "- Continue to run test suites\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a list of practices that I think is worth education scientists on. In order to move away from technical language used in Computer Science I think it's useful to use metaphors in phases that might be more memorable than a technical term.\n",

    "Software Development Methodologies are based around the following steps:\n",
    "1. Requirements (what does it need to do)\n",
    "1. Design (figure out what the code should look like)\n",
    "1. Implement (actually do coding)\n",
    "1. Test (verify that the code is correct)\n",
    "1. Deploy (Finish it and give to others)\n",
    "1. Refactor (Improve design – just for Agile)\n",

    "The best way to write good scientific code -- is to work in a team that can point out how to improve code you write, as well as having you make suggestions for code that others write. Very often scientists are embarrassed about sharing their code with RSEs. This is a tendency that needs to be overcome, with gentle encouragement. It also means developing good team dynamics where people can be vulnerable with the code they share with others. This is especially effective when the code sharing goes both ways, and since I know you are going to review my code, I know to be gentle with my review of your code -- because you are going to do the same for me. It also helps to realize code is a shared resource, we all want to improve it for the benefit of everyone. It helps to let go of the idea of the code I write is `mine`. It also helps to realize that everyone writes terrible code. This is for a variety of reasons, but especially because of lack of time for example. Getting oer that embarrassment helps us to share and improve our code as a team.\n",
