    "# What Practices does the SE Industry Show Helps?\n",
    "\n",
    "As such SE Industry and Research has found the following practices help:\n",
    "Figure out what the software needs to do REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "(neither too much or too little)\n",
    "Spend effort into DESIGN of the code itself\n",
    "Add automated TESTING WHILE you develop\n",

    "# RSE Maxim to Live By\n",
    "\n",
    "Untested Code – IS broken (or will get broken)\n",
    "So…\n",
    "Don’t add untested code\n",
    "Do testing and add testing to test suites\n",
    "Continue to run test suites\n",

    "# List of RSE Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small circle JuJitsu (small cycles)\n",
    "- Trim the fat (requirements)\n",
    "- Draw the building (design code changes before starting)\n",
    "- Preserve success (git version control)\n",
    "- Practice vulnerability (openly share code/issues)\n",
    "- Trust but verify – test AS you go (Test Driven Development TDD)\n",

    "Software Development Methodologies are based around the following steps:\n",
    "1. Requirements (what does it need to do)\n",
    "1. Design (figure out what the code should look like)\n",
    "1. Implement (actually do coding)\n",
    "1. Test (verify that the code is correct)\n",
    "1. Deploy (Finish it and give to others)\n",
    "1. Refactor (Improve design – just for ASD)\n",

    "Waterfall Software Development:  is one extreme with one monolithic pass\n",
    "Agile Software Development: is at the other with continually doing small cycles of the above\n",
